## Tech-Stack
In our web application, we utilize the following technologies:
- **React:** We use React, a powerful JavaScript library, to create the user interface of our application. It allows us to build interactive and responsive components.
- **Spring Boot:** Our backend is built using the Spring Boot framework. It provides a robust and efficient platform for developing Java-based web applications and microservices.
- **MySQL:** We utilize MySQL, a popular relational database management system, to store and manage our application's data. It offers a reliable and scalable solution for persistent data storage.
- **Swagger:** We leverage Swagger, a comprehensive tooling ecosystem for designing, building, documenting, and consuming RESTful APIs. It allows us to create clear and interactive documentation for our APIs.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token):** To handle authentication and authorization in our application, we employ JSON Web Tokens. JWTs provide a secure method for transmitting data between parties and are commonly used for authentication purposes.
- **JUnit 5:** We adopt JUnit 5, a widely used unit testing framework for Java applications, to ensure the quality and correctness of our backend code. It enables us to write and execute tests to verify the expected behavior of our application's components.

### Doctor Dashboard
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<ul>
<li>Calendar: The dashboard includes a calendar component that displays the doctor's appointments. The appointments are fetched from an API using the axios library and stored in the state variable appointmentsSet. The calendar component is rendered with the appointment data, and each appointment can be clicked to view more details.</li>

<li>Baby Table: The dashboard displays a table of baby patients, fetched from an API using the axios library and stored in the state variable selectedBabyTableData. Each row in the table represents a baby patient and includes information such as baby ID, baby name, parent name, gender, allocated midwife, and appointment status. The appointment status is determined by checking if there is a pending appointment for the baby. If an appointment is pending, a button is displayed to indicate the status, and clicking on the button opens the appointment details.</li>

<li>Baby Details Card: When a row in the baby table is clicked, a modal card component called DoctorBabyDetailsCard is displayed. It shows detailed information about the selected baby, including vaccination details. The DoctorBabyDetailsCard component receives the selected baby data as props and provides a callback function to update the table when changes are made.
</li>

<li>Appointment Details Card: When an appointment button is clicked in the baby table or on the calendar, a modal card component called DoctorAppointmentDetailsCard is displayed. It shows detailed information about the selected appointment, including the parent's name, baby's name, scheduled date and time, and venue. The DoctorAppointmentDetailsCard component provides buttons to accept the appointment or suggest a different date. Accepting an appointment sends a POST request to an API to update the appointment status.</li>
</ul>
